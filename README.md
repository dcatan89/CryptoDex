# CryptoDex

This project is a real time web application that grabs current cryptocurrency global stats and populates the data into an easy to follow UI. Users can view real time data, search their favorite cryptos while saving them to a watchlist, and view the current trending cryptocurriencies.

A web application for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as well as casual traders who want raw easy to follow data.

I wanted to build this application because it combined my interest in cryptos with wanting to implement my knowledge of restful APIs. Some web apps are hard to follow and can be confusing to read for people who don't generally follow stock exchanges so I wanted to build this application for ease of use.
